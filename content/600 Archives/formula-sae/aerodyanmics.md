# Gas laws
$$\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1}=\text{constant}=\frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$$
$P$ is absolute pressure
$V$ is air volume
$T$ is absolute temperature (in kelvin)
and there is alternative equation 
$$\frac{P_1}{T_1\rho_1}=\text{constant}=\frac{P_2}{T_2\rho_2}$$
$\rho$ is air density

## Atmospheric pressure ($P_{sl}$ )
$$P_{sl} \cdot e^{-(h/7000)}$$
# Laminar vs Turbulent flow
Laminar - clean air, parallels to the average direction of flow
Turbulent - dirty air, disordered, chaotic
# Bernoulli equation
1. KE from fluids, $1/2 m v^2$
2. Pressure energy, $PV$
3. Potential energy from fluid, $mh$
$$\frac12mv^2+PV+mh = constant$$
$$\frac12mv^2+P\frac m \rho+mh = constant$$
$$\frac12v^2+\frac P\rho+h = constant$$
For air the PE term can be negligible
$$\frac12 \rho v^2+P = constant$$
Now all $P$ that is left is the static pressure 
# Reynold's Number
$$Re = \frac{\rho v L}{ \mu}$$
$\rho$ is air density
$\mu$ is air viscosity
$v$ is air velocity
$L$ is typical dimension, example length of car
# Boundary layer
## Laminar
$$\text{tickness}=\frac{4.91x}{\sqrt{Re_x}}$$
## Turbulent
$$\text{tickness}=\frac{0.382x}{Re_x^{1/5}}$$
