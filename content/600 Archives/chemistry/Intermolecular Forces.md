Forces between the molecules
# Types (Weak to Strong)
- London Dispersion Forces 
- Dipole-dipole interaction
- Hydrogen bonding
- Ion-dipole forces
## London Dispersion Forces  
Occur in: 
- Nonpolar molecules
- [[Main group element#Noble gasses]]
Separations of charges within a molecules
Cause by temporary dipole
Factor that determine the magnitude of LDF:
1. Polarizability
2. Contact area - Greater the area, greater the LDF
Polarizability depend on:
- Molecule size
- Number of [[Atomic structure#Electron]]
## Dipole-dipole interaction
Occur in: Polar molecules
When they have the dipole-diploe, they will also have [[#London Dispersion Forces]]
The positive end and negative will attract with each other.
## Hydrogen bonding
Occur in: Highly polar molecules
When they have H-bonding, they will also have [[#London Dispersion Forces]] and [[#Dipole-dipole interaction]]
This is when Hydrogen is bond to the highly electronegative atoms N,O,F
## Ion-dipole forces
Occur in: Ion and polar molecules
This is about ion and molecule, while the other 3 is talking about molecule and molecule
