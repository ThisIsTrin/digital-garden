Nonmetal + Nonmetal
Sharing of [[Atomic structure#Electron]]
overlapping of electron cloud
Has small difference of [[Ionization Energy]]
Has two type:
1. Polar - [[Atomic structure#Electron]] are share unequally
2. Non-Polar - [[Atomic structure#Electron]] are shared equally

# Single, Double, Triple Bond
Single 
- share 2 [[Atomic structure#Electron]]-
- Longest distance
- weakest bond 
Double 
- share 4 [[Atomic structure#Electron]]
Triple 
- share 6 [[Atomic structure#Electron]]
- Shortest distance
- Strongest bond

## Type of [[Atomic structure#Electron]] overlapping
Sigma bond ($\sigma$)
- when overlapping is on the internuclear axis
- Could be in S or P [[Electron Subshells|Sub-Orbital]]
Pi bond ($\pi$)
- when overlapping is not on the internuclear axis
- Only in P [[Electron Subshells|Sub-Orbital]]
