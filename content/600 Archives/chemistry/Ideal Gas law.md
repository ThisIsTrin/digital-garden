This is hypothetical gas, made to be simpler without the [[Intermolecular Forces|IMF]]
$$ PV= nRT $$
Pressure is also frequency of collision
# Assumptions
- Have no [[Intermolecular Forces|IMF]]
- Particle is small size
- There is big space for the particle
The assumptions came from [[Kinetic Molecular Theory]]
