**Analogy**: Like an aspiring chef who refines knowledge over time by learning from a vast collection of "recipes" (texts). 

**Training Process**: Over time, the model becomes better at understanding word relationships and context.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a subset of artificial intelligence that focus on understanding and generating human language. This lecture explores LLMs, their key concepts, and their real-life applications.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
AI enables machines to mimic human intelligence and problem-solving skills. 
## Machine Learning (ML) 
ML is a branch of AI that uses data and algorithms to mimic human learning and enhance accuracy. 
## Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
NLP focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. Its goal is to develop systems that understand human language effectively. 
## Deep Learning (DL) 
DL is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.
# Applications of LLMs

## Real-Life Applications
- **Chatbots**: For customer service and support.
- **Translation**: Language translation services.
- **Assistants**: Virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.
- **Creative Uses**: Generating art, writing, and more.
