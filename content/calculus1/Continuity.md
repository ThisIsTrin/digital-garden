Continuous if it has no "holes", break, or asymptotes
Holes in formal term is removeable discontinuity

The function will be continuous at point $c$ if:
1. $f(c)$ is defined
2. $\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)$ exist
3. $\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = f(c)$

For rational function:
If $\frac 0 0$ then it is hole discontinuity
if $\frac{\text{constant}} 0$ it is asymptote
