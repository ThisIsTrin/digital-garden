# Reviewing Strategies
When it's time to review, these rule can help you:
1. Summarize in writing - Write main idea in your own words
2. Summarize out loud - Explain the idea like you are teaching someone
3. Review and Reflect - Think about the idea and how it relate to other idea you know.
4. Read and Review often - Review the idea regularly, last minute is not a good idea
