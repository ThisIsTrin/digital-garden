# John Stuart Mill's Methods
Proposed in his book "A System of Logic"

Three main methods:
1. Method of Agreement - Looks for common factors in instances where the effect occurs
2. Method of Difference - Identifies missing factors in instances where the effect doesn't occur
3. Joint Method of Agreement and Difference - Combines the first two approaches
