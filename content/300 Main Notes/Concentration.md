# Concentration
Concentration is the amount of solute in a given quantity of solvent or solution. Concentration tells us how much solute is dissolved in a certain amount of solution or solvent.

It's like measuring how strong a juice is - more concentrate means stronger flavor.
## Common concentration units
### Percent by mass 
$$\frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{mass of solution}} \cdot  100$$
### Mole fraction 
$$\frac{\text{moles of component}}{ \text{total moles of all components}}$$ 
### Molarity (M)
$$\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{liters of solution}}$$
### Molality (m)
$$\frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kg of solvent}} $$
