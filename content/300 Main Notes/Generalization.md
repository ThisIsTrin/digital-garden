# Generalization
Generalization is a type of [[Inductive vs Deductive Arguments#Inductive Arguments]]
where a conclusion about a population is drawn based on a sample. Key points include:

- Scientists often use generalization in research.
- Data collection processes like polls and surveys use inductive generalization.
- Sampling techniques are crucial, with random and representative sampling being ideal.
- The sample size needed depends on the population size and variation within it.
- Question wording in surveys can significantly affect responses. Loaded questions and push polls should be avoided.

Applying generalizations to individual cases requires caution. The higher the prevalence of a characteristic in a population, the more likely it applies to an individual.
