# Different learning style

If you are left brain, then you will like stuff that is in order
They like to learn stuff in parts

If you are right brain, then you enjoy things that are random
While the right side like to learn stuff as a whole.

## Left-brained
Like something that is predictable, and properly structure. They also work best when presented with characters (read). Internal focus.  Phonetic reading system will help these type of people.
