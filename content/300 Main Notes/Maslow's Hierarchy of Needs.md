# Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

This is a pyramid that show what motivate people, 

The basic need is called Physiological needs, this is the basic such as food habitat and more

Next, is the Safety need, this is such as health, employment, basically wealth.

Next is Loves one, Love and Belonging. Wealth with no one to use with is not yet at successful state, we want someone to spend our wealth, and we all love sex.

Self Esteem, after love and belonging, (Esteem mean respect) this one is all about self-respect.

Lastly, Self Actualization, this one will be when we have the fullest potentials.
