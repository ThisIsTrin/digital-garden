# Zettelkasten System
People like to say this is one of the powerful note taking system, but I ask my self why?

It originated form a slip boxed system

This system allows us to relate the topics, which help our brains so good

Separate notes into
1. Literature - Stuff form other
2. Permeant - Our ideas, written in our own words and link to other notes
3. Hub - Topics and subtopics, help you find permeant notes.
4. Fleeting - Random notes
