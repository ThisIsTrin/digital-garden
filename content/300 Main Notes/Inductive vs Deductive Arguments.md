# Inductive vs Deductive Arguments
## Inductive Arguments
Inductive arguments claim that their conclusion probably follows from their premises

Inductive arguments support their conclusions with probability

Inductive arguments can be strengthened or weakened by additional evidence

 Inductive arguments are evaluated as strong or weak, and if strong with true premises, they're considered cogent. 
## Deductive Arguments
Deductive arguments which claim the conclusion necessarily follows

Deductive arguments guarantee their conclusions if the premises are true.

Deductive arguments are either valid or invalid.

Deductive arguments are evaluated as valid or invalid, and if valid with true premises, they're considered sound.
