# Application of Limit

## Intermediate value theorem
If $f$ is continuous on interval $[a, b]$ and let N be any number that is
$$f(a) < N > f(b)$$
there will be point that
$$f(c) = N$$

This is used to prove that there is another solution in a certain interval

## Newtons method 
$$X_n = x_{n-1} - \frac{f(x_{n-1})}{f'(x_{n-1}}$$
