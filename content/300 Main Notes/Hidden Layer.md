## Determine the number of Hidden Layers
No definite method to find the number of [[Neuron]] in the hidden layers

Practical approach: Use multiples of 8

Trial and error is the answer

Researcher various formula to help calculate $N_h$ , These formulas is usually based on:

- Number of neurons in input layer (Ni)
- Number of neurons in output layer (No)
- Number of samples (N)

	Use the max and min of the calculated values as a range for Nh
