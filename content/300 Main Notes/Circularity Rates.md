# Circularity Rates
Measures the share of recycled material fed back into the economy

$$CMU = U/M$$

where $U = RCV(R) - IMP(w) + EXP(w)$ and $M=DMC+U$

- RCV(R): Recycling, based on treatment operations
- IMP(w): Amount of imported waste bound for recycling
- EXP(w): Amount of exported waste bound for recycling

```ad-question
What does CMU stand for in the circularity rate formula?
```
