# Misuse of Inductive Reasoning
## Chicken and Egg Fallacy
Assumes one event must cause another just because they occur together

E.g. Linking violent behavior to playing violent video games
## Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc (False Cause)
Assumes that if one event precedes another, it must be the cause.

E.g. Concluding a computer program causes crashes because it was opened before the crash.
