# Solutions
A solution is a uniform mixture of two or more substances.

Solute - things that get dissolved (usually smaller amount)

Solvent - things that does the dissolving (usually larger amount)
## Type of Solutions
1. Saturated: Contains the maximum amount of solute that can dissolve at a specific temperature. 
2. Unsaturated: Contains less solute than the solvent can dissolve at a specific temperature.
3. Supersaturated: Contains more solute than a saturated solution at a specific temperature.
## Interactions
When a solute dissolves in a solvent, its particles spread throughout the solvent.
Solute particles take positions normally occupied by solvent molecules.

## Types of interactions
1. Solvent-solvent interaction 
2. Solute-solute interaction 
3. Solvent-solute interaction

## "like dissolves like" principles
- Non-polar molecules dissolve in non-polar solvents
- Polar molecules dissolve in polar solvents
- Ionic compounds are more soluble in polar solvents

Miscible substances can dissolve in each other in all proportions. In simple, can mix in any amount.
