# Solubility 
Substance with similar [[Intermolecular Forces]] tends to be soluble with each other
## Based on temperature
For most solid solutes in liquids:
- Higher temperature usually means more can dissolve (solubility increases with temperature).
- Think of sugar in hot tea vs. cold tea - hot tea can dissolve more sugar.

For gases in liquids:
- Higher temperature usually means less gas can dissolve (solubility decreases with increasing temperature).
- This is why warm soda goes flat faster than cold soda.

Fractional crystallization:
- A way to separate mixed substances based on how they dissolve at different temperatures.
- Example: Separating salt and sugar from a mixed solution by cooling it slowly.
- As it cools, one substance (like sugar) might form crystals first, which can be filtered out.

## Based on pressure
### Henry laws
The solubility of a gas in a liquid is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas above the solution.

This principle is applied in carbonated beverages.

Formula
$$c = kP$$
where $c$ is [[Concentration]], $k$ is Henry's law constant, and $P$ is pressure.
