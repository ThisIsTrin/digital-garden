[[Five-Part Reading System]] and [[SQ3R]] cover some of it already, but here is some overall rule of thumb:
1. Determine your purpose - What is your purpose for reading? (fun, knowledge, etc.)
2. Set reading goals - Set goals to know are you on tracks
3. Concentrate - Focus and dont get distracted
4. Create and outline - Write main points as you read
5. Identify keywords and concepts - focus on keywords, main concept
7. make connections - relate to the thing you already 
8. Imagine you're talking to the author - ask questions and think carefully 
9. compare notes 
10. Take frequent break
11. Integrate learning style
12. Use entire text
