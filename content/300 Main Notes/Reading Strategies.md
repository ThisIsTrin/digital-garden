# Reading Strategies
[[Five-Part Reading System]] and [[SQ3R]] cover some of it already, but here is some overall rule of thumb:
1. Determine your purpose - What is your purpose for reading? (fun, knowledge, etc.)
2. Set reading goals - Set goals to know are you on tracks
3. Concentrate - Focus and don't get distracted
4. Create and outline - Write main points as you read
5. Identify keywords and concepts - focus on keywords, main concept
7. make connections - relate to the thing you already 
8. Imagine you're talking to the author - ask questions and think carefully 
9. compare notes - Share ideas/concept to get opinion on the concept/idea and in case you miss something.
10. Take frequent break - don't try to read for long, optimal time is 45 min to 1 hour
11. Integrate learning style - if you learn beter by listen read out loud
13. Use entire text - Try ot read everything don't skip anything
