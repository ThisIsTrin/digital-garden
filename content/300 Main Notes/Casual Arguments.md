# Casual Arguments
Events that brings about a change or produce and effect

Casual arguments claim something is (or is not) the cause of something else

E.g. Eating too many French fries and not exercising causing weight gain

```ad-question
How does the lesson define a "cause," and why are causal arguments considered inductive rather than deductive? 
```
%%  A cause is defined as "an event that brings about a change or produces an effect." Causal arguments are considered inductive because their conclusions are probable but not certain, leaving room for exceptions or alternative explanations. %%
