# Integration by Substitution
If $u = g(x)$, then $$\int f(g(x)) \cdot g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du$$
Steps:
1. Choose $u = g(x)$
2. Find $du = g'(x) dx$
3. Substitute and integrate
4. Substitute back for x 

We also can manipulate the $u$ where it will from a variable that will be able to plug in the initial question to cancel out.
