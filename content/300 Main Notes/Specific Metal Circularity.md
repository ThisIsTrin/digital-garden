# Specific Metal Circularity
## Current
Steel: 85% recycling rate, 56% becomes new stainless steel, 29% used as iron source for carbon steels

Recycled steel reduces air pollution by up to 86%, water pollution by 76%, water usage by 40%

Aluminum: Second-largest production volume, high energy demand for primary synthesis via electrolysis

Nickel, Cobalt, Lithium: Critical for electric vehicle batteries, expected 20-fold increase in demand by 2040

 Copper demand expected to double from 2020 to 2050

```ad-question
What percentage of recycled steel becomes new stainless steel?

```
## Future prediction
- Peak in scrap return expected around 2060
- By 2050-2060, potentially 2/3 of mass-produced metals could be made from scrap
- Metal consumption forecast to double by 2060
- By 2050-2060, 2/3 of greenhouse-gas-intensive mass market for metals (iron, aluminum, nickel, titanium) will be circular on average
- 1/3 will remain linear (based on mining, refining, and primary reduction)

```ad-question
What fraction of the greenhouse-gas-intensive mass market for metals is projected to be circular by 2050-2060?

```
