# Application of Derivatives

## Maximum and Minimum
1. Find critical point
2. Plug critical point and the end points to the function
3. Compare
## Extreme Value Theorem
$f(x)$ is continuous on interval $[a,b]$  where $a\le c$, and $d \le b$
$f(c)$ is an absolute max
$f(d)$ is an absolute min
## Fermat’s Theorem
If f(x) has a relative extrema at x=c and f′(c) exists then x=c is a critical point of f(x). In fact, it will be a critical point such that f′(c)=0.
## Mean Value Theorem
If there is $f$ that satisfied these condition:
1. $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$
2. $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$
Then
$$ f'(c) = \frac{f(b) − f(a)}{b-a}$$
$c \in (a,b)$
## Rolle's Theorem
If there is $f$ that satisfied these condition:
1. $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$
2. $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$
3. $f(a) = f(b)$ 
then there is
$$f'(c) = 0$$
$c \in (a,b)$
## Concavity
$f''(x)$ is positive then concave up
$f''(x)$ is negative then concave down
$f''(x) = 0$ is infliction point
