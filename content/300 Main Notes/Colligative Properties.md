# Colligative Properties
Properties that depend only on the number of solute particles, not their nature.

## Main colligative properties: 
### Vapor pressure lowering 
Adding solute makes it harder for solvent to evaporate.

Raoult's Law 
$$P_1 = X_1P^{\circ}_1$$
Where, $P_1$ is new vapor pressure, $X_1$ is solvent's [[Concentration#Mole fraction]], $P^{\circ}_1$ is pure solvent's vapor pressure

#### For Multiple Volatile Components
- If both the solvent and solute can evaporate, Raoult's Law applies to each
$$P_A = X_AP^{\circ}_A$$$$P_B = X_BP^{\circ}_B$$
- The total vapor pressure is the sum of these:
$$P_T = P_A + P_B$$
#### Ideal vs. Real Solutions
Raoult's Law assumes an "ideal solution" where solvent-solute interactions are identical to solvent-solvent interactions.

Real solutions often deviate from this law:
- Positive deviation: Total pressure is higher than predicted (e.g., acetone-chloroform mixture)
- Negative deviation: Total pressure is lower than predicted (e.g., chloroform-acetone mixture)
#### Applications
Fractional distillation:
- Used to separate liquids with different boiling points.
- The mixture is heated, and different components vaporize at different temperatures
- Crude oil processing
### Boiling point elevation:
Solutions boil at higher temperatures than pure solvents.

$$\Delta T_b = K_bm $$
Where, $\Delta T_b$ is boiling point increase, $K_b$ is a constant for the solvent, $m$ is [[Concentration#Molality (m)]]
### Freezing point depression
Solutions freeze at lower temperatures than pure solvents.

$$\Delta T_f = K_fm$$ 

Where, $\Delta T_f$ is freezing point decrease, $K_f$ is a constant for the solvent, m is [[Concentration#Molality (m)]]
#### Application
- Making ice cream: Adding salt to ice lowers its melting point, creating a super-cold mixture.
- De-icing roads: Salt lowers the freezing point of water, melting ice on roads.
### Osmotic pressure
Pressure needed to stop water flow through a semipermeable membrane.

$$\pi = MRT$$
Where $\pi$ is osmotic pressure, $M$ is [[Concentration#Molality (m)]], $R$ is gas constant, $T$ is temperature
#### Application
- Crucial in biology: How water moves in and out of cells.
- Water purification: Reverse osmosis forces water through a membrane, leaving impurities behind.

> [!note] For solutions with ions (like salt in water)
> Use van't Hoff factor ($i$) to account for the extra particles from dissociation. Multiply the above equations by $i$.
