# Force in X axis
$$\Sigma F_x = ma_x = F_{Tire} - F_{RR} - F_{Drag}$$
RR is [[#Rolling Resistance]]
# Rolling Resistance
$$F_{RR} = \mu_{RR} (N_{Rear} + N_{Front}) = \mu_{RR} W$$
$\mu_{RR}$ is the coefficient of rolling resistance
# Drag
We are in high [[Reynolds number]] (much greater than 1)
$$F_{Drag} = \frac1 2 A_F C_d \rho v^2$$
$A_F$ is the Frontal Area Cross section of the car 
$C_d$ is the drag coefficient (so hard to get low especially with the firewall)
$\rho$ is the density of the air
$v$ is the velocity
The only thing we can modified and make it small as possible is the $A_F$ and $C_d$
Due to high Reynold number the flow is slow therefore density plays bigger effect than viscosity
# Engine Power
$$P_{Engine} = F_{Tire}v$$
Using the equation above we an rearrange to this:
$$P_{Engine} = ma_xv + \mu_{RR} W v+ \frac{1}{2} A_F C_d \rho v^3$$
What does this equation tell:
[[#Drag|Aerodynamics]] will eats take a lot from the $P_{Engine}$ during high speed 
and  during high speed we don't accelerating that much either therefore the $ma_x v$ term will be small
$ma_x v$ will be the dominant term during the low speed
