Forces between the molecules
# Types (Weak to Strong)
- London Dispersion Forces 
- Dipole-dipole interaction
- Hydrogen bonding
- Ion-dipole forces
## London Dispersion Forces  
Occur in: 
- Nonpolar molecules
- [[Main group element#Noble gasses]]
Separations of charges within a molecules
Cause by temporary dipole
Factor that determine the magnitude of LDT:
1. Polarizability
2. Contact area
Polarizability depend on:
- Molecule size
- Number of [[Atomic structure#Electron]]
## Dipole-dipole interaction
Occur in: Polar molecules
## Hydrogen bonding
Occur in: Highly polar molecules
## Ion-dipole forces
Occur in: Ion and polar molecules
