Random motion continuously
No attractive Forces
# Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
Kinetic Energy of particles at given temperature, $KE = \frac12 m v^2$
![[figure-14-04-05.jpg]]
$T1$ is at low temperature
$T2$ is at high temperature
# Average Kinetic Energy
depend on Temperature
# Average Speed
$$ KE = \frac12 m v^2 $$
Larger molar mass, the more slower the [[#Average Speed]] become
