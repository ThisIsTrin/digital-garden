Only nonmetals, Example Si, C
# Properties
Have high melting point
Have High boiling point
Rigid
Hard
# Diamond vs Graphite
Carbon have 4 valence electron
## Diamond
Carbon molecules will bond to another 4 carbon molecules
Poor conductor
## Graphite
Carbon molecules will bon with another 3 carbon molecules
This leave it left with 1 electron
Good conductor, because have one free electron
