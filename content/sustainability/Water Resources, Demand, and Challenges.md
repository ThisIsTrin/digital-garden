# Main Water Sources 
- **Rainwater**: Water vapor that condenses and falls as rain.
- **Surface Water**: Found in rivers, lakes, seas, etc., and exposed to the atmosphere.
- **Groundwater**: Water stored underground, often clear and filtered by soil.
# Water Availability
- Only 3% of Earthâ€™s water is freshwater, and less than 1% is easily accessible.
- Most freshwater is trapped in glaciers and ice caps.
# Global Water Demand
- Expected to increase by 20-30% by 2050.
- Agriculture uses 70% of water, and industry uses 20%.
# Water Footprint
- Total freshwater used to produce the goods/services consumed by individuals or communities.
# Water Scarcity
- **Physical Scarcity**: Not enough water to meet demands, common in arid regions. 
- **Economic Scarcity**: Lack of infrastructure or resources to access water.
  Scarcity is short of supply
# Causes of Water Scarcity
- Droughts 
- [[#Impact of Climate Change|Climate change]]
- Poor water management
- [[#Water Pollution|Pollution]]
- Increased [[#Water Depletion in Agriculture/Industry|demand]]
## Impact of Climate Change
- Increased evaporation
- Changing precipitation patterns
- More frequent droughts/floods
- Potential decline in water quality
## Water Depletion in Agriculture/Industry
- Agriculture uses vast amounts of water, with significant losses due to evaporation/seepage.
- Industries like cement, steel, and paper production consume large amounts of water.

Production of 1kg wheat require 500 liters of water
## Water Pollution
- [[#Emerging Contaminants|Contaminated]] water from sewage, industrial runoff, and agricultural pesticides affects availability.
### Emerging Contaminants
- Pharmaceuticals, microplastics, and other pollutants not removed by current treatment methods pose new risks.
# Global Water Security
  - Over 2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, and many live in water-stressed regions.
